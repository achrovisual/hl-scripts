## üöÄ Overview

This repository is a collection of essential **Shell Scripts** designed for the setup, management, and maintenance of a **Home Lab** environment. It covers a range of utilities, from managing **K3s** (lightweight Kubernetes) clusters and service-specific tasks like **Minecraft server management**, to low-level network and security configurations for devices like **EdgeOS** and **RouterOS**.

The goal is to provide **reproducible** and **convenient** automation for common system administration and homelab operations.
